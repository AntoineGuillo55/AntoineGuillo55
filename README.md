## Hi ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github profile !

I currently work as a web developer for an e-commerce company specialising in adult products. It's a study-work contrat to prepare the "Concepteur DÃ©veloppeur d'Applications" degree (BAC +4) which end the 19 December 2025.

As a web developer in black sequoia, my job is to develop custom prestashop modules and wordpress plugins to implement new features on our websites, and to maintain them using a ticketing system.

On a daily basis, I use the following technologies: Prestashop, WordPress, PHP, Smarty, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Do you think that working on a CMS boils down to front-end HTML/CSS work? Not at all! 

I contributed to the development of two Prestashop modules that allow customer reviews to be obtained via an API.
I also created, from conception to development, a Prestashop module that allows you to set up a personalised loyalty programme with the following features :

- Earn rewards in points when making purchases and convert these points into loyalty vouchers
- Referral programme, with rewards in points for the referrer and a free product for the referee
- Status system with specific gifts and benefits
- Option to configure periods during which points are multiplied
- Automated transactional emails
- Interface for tracking programme usage statistics

To realize this modules I had to use and increase my knowledge in POO, MVC design pattern, SQL, unit testing and web security. 

I'm studying in the ENI school in Chartres-de-Bretagne. During my training, I studied the following technologies:
- Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, jdbc and Hibernate
- PHP, Symfony and Doctrine
- NodeJs, Typescript and AngularJS
- I'm about to learn Python with an AI projet durong 3 weeks
- Docker
- Web Security
- SQL (MySQL and SQL Server), NoSQL (MongoDB)
- Github
- Poject management
- Agile concepts (SCRUM)
